README
This program implements an ant colony optimization algorithm to solve the Shelf Picking Problem.

Problem Description
The Shelf Picking Problem involves finding the shortest route for a worker to pick items from a set of shelves. The shelves are represented by a set of coordinates and the distance between each pair of shelves is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by the worker.

Usage
Install the necessary dependencies:


This code has several excellent features:

Modularity: The code is divided into distinct sections with clear headings, making it easy to understand and modify.

Efficient algorithms: The code implements the ant colony optimization algorithm, a widely-used algorithm for solving complex optimization problems. It also calculates the distances between shelves and updates the pheromones effectively.

Use of libraries: The code imports and uses the NumPy, random, math, and string libraries, which are powerful tools for scientific computing, generating random numbers, performing mathematical operations, and working with strings.

Good variable naming: The variables are well-named and descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each variable.

Good commenting: The code is well-documented with comments explaining each section and the purpose of each variable.

numpy
random
math
string
Define the shelf coordinates in the shelves dictionary. The keys should be uppercase letters from A to Z, and the values should be tuples containing the x and y coordinates of the shelf.

Set the parameters for the ant colony optimization algorithm:

num_ants: the number of ants in the colony
alpha: the weight of the pheromone trail in the probability calculation
beta: the weight of the distance between shelves in the probability calculation
rho: the pheromone evaporation rate
max_iter: the maximum number of iterations to run the algorithm
pheromone_add: the amount of pheromone to add to the trail after each iteration
Run the program to obtain the shortest route and its length.

Algorithm Details
The ant colony optimization algorithm works as follows:

Initialize the pheromone trail matrix with a value of 1 for each edge between shelves.
For each iteration:
Each ant in the colony finds a route by selecting the next shelf to visit based on a probability distribution that considers the pheromone trail and the distance between shelves.
The pheromone trail matrix is updated based on the routes found by the ants.
After all iterations, the shortest route found by the ants is returned.
